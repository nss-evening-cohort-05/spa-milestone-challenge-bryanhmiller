      "description": "This 1969 Ford Mustang was built by Restomod Performance in collaboration with Valvoline Australia. The project kept the engine displacement the same but increased the power and technology by about 42 years. The original 302 ci V8 was replaced by a 5.0 L (302 ci) Coyote V8 from a Mustang GT."

      "description": "It used a front-hinged door and a 9.5 horsepower 236cc split-single two-stroke engine. Top speed was 47 mph but the design caught on and when Rivolta wanted to focus on sports cars, he licensed the design out to multiple companies all over the world. Produced from 1953 until 1955, only about 1,000 were built. But it was the first. This one should sell for between $30,000-$40,000."
